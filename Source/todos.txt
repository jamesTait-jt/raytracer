EXTENSIONS TODO NOW: Soft shadows with area light

Soft shadows is achieved by sampling multiple point lights in the region of a sphere.
We would then have multiple light sources to trace every pixel value back to, we can
then take an average of the amount of light received to calculate the pixels illumination.
For example say the light on the top middle of the room, we sample 50 different points within
that sphere. We now have 50 different point light sources. Now for a point which is in the middle
of the room which successfully traces back to all other lights without being occluded it will be
fully lit. However a point say near the corner of a box will only be reached by some of the light
sources, so it will have a lower luminance.

- Sample random positions within a spherical region in the main function to dictate
  where our light goes.

- When raytracing check against all of these points when determining the illumination
  of an object in the scene.

================================================================================

- Percentage reflexivity required

- Fix black bit which appears in some reflections

- BRDFs - a more realistic way to parametrise the ray-surface interaction

- Procedural textures

- Bump and environment mapping

- Depth of field

- Pathtracing

- Perfect sphere
